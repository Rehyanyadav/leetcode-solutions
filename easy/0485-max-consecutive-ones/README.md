![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given a binary array nums, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array.

 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,0,1,1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s. The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.


Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,0,1,1,0,1]
Output: 2


 
Constraints:


	1 <= nums.length <= 105
	nums[i] is either 0 or 1.

                count++;
                maxi = max(maxi, count); // Is my current streak a new record?
            } else {
                count = 0; // Streak broken, reset to 0
            }
        }
        
        return maxi;
    }
};
