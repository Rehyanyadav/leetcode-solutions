# Merge Intervals

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.

 
Example 1:

Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, merge them into [1,6].


Example 2:

Input: intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: [[1,5]]
Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.


Example 3:

Input: intervals = [[4,7],[1,4]]
Output: [[1,7]]
Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,7] are considered overlapping.


 
Constraints:


	1 <= intervals.length <= 104
	intervals[i].length == 2
	0 <= starti <= endi <= 104

          sort(intervals.begin(), intervals.end());
          vector<vector<int>> result;
          result.push_back(intervals[0]);
          for(int i =1; i<intervals.size(); i++){
            if(intervals[i][0] <= result.back()[1]){
                result.back()[1] = max(result.back()[1],intervals[i][1]);

            }
            else{
                result.push_back(intervals[i]);

            }

          }
          return result;
//Time  complexity is O(NLogN) because  -> n for loop traversal and logn for  sorting O(n)+O(logn)


    }
};
